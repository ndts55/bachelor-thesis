\chapter{Conclusion}
% TODO Write conclusion.
% Clearly state the answer to the main research question
% Summarize and reflect on the research
% Make recommendations for future work on the topic
% Show what new knowledge you have contributed

% summarize what we did in this thesis.
% - presented Paxos (why Paxos? because it is basic Paxos. it is quintessential Paxos), FTMPST, additional syntax+semantics for FTMPST (which specifically? introduced "function calls as prefixes" to manipulate registers )
% - constructed global type and processes
% - presented an example run
% - proven that processes fulfill the global type via type check
% - proofs for validity, agreement, and termination for the model

% what difficulties did we encounter when creating the model?
% - working around the concept of a quorum made the model more complex
% - without quorums (if every proposer just communicated with every acceptor) the processes (specifically system initialization) would be simpler

% what could be future work?
% - analyse how close the model is to the actual algorithm
% - comparison with other models for the same algorithm
% - extension of the model to include learners
