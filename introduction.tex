% coordinating processes?
% - processes that need to achieve one goal together
% - accessing shared data
% - ensure correct (distributed) computation
% - reliable distributed coordination
In distributed computing, it is often necessary for coordinating processes to reach consensus, i.e., agree on the value of some data that are needed during computation.
% avoid using 'necessitates'
These processes agree on the same values to ensure correct computation, which necessitates a correct consensus algorithm.
Thus, proving the correctness of consensus algorithms is important.
To achieve consensus these algorithms must satisfy the following properties: termination, validity, and agreement \cite{dist_sys}.

Due to the presence of faulty processes consensus algorithms are designed to be fault-tolerant.

Proving these properties can be complicated.
Model checking tools lead to big state-spaces so static analysis is preferable.
Multiparty Session Types are particularly interesting since session typing can ensure the absence of communication errors and deadlocks, and protocol conformance \cite{mpstbd}.
However, to properly model unreliable communication between processes a fault-tolerant extension to Multiparty Session Types is necessary.

\citeauthor{ftmpst} developed such an extension.

% \section{Task}
% \IMRADlabel{methods}
% The task for the upcoming work can be split into two subtasks.
% First, fault-tolerant Multiparty Session Types\cite{ftmpst} are used for the analysis of Paxos\cite{lamport2001paxos}.
% Second, the applicability of fault-tolerant Multiparty Session Types to such analyses is evaluated.

% For the first subtask a model of the Paxos algorithm will be constructed.
% This model will be manually verified using the reduction rules for (fault-tolerant) Multiparty Session Types\cite{mp_async_st,ftmpst}.

% The second part will be an evaluation of the applicability of fault-tolerant Multiparty Session Types to such analyses.
% Both the model and its verification from the previous part are evaluated to determine how well fault-tolerant Multiparty Session Types are suited to real-world analyses.

% \section{Possible difficulties}
% \IMRADlabel{results}

% It might not be entirely possible to build an appropriate model of Paxos with fault-tolerant Multiparty Session Types.
