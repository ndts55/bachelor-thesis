abstract = {At the PODC 2001 conference, I got tired of everyone saying how difficult it was to understand the Paxos algorithm, published in [122]. Although people got so hung up in the pseudo-Greek names that they found the paper hard to understand, the algorithm itself is very simple. So, I cornered a couple of people at the conference and explained the algorithm to them orally, with no paper. When I got home, I wrote down the explanation as a short note, which I later revised based on comments from Fred Schneider and Butler Lampson. The current version is 13 pages long, and contains no formula more complicated than n1 &gt; n2.},

As a potential typed foundation for structured communication-centred programming, session types have been studied over the last decade for a wide range of process calculi and programming languages, focussing on binary (two-party) sessions. This work extends the foregoing theories of binary session types to multiparty, asynchronous sessions, which often arise in practical communication-centred applications. Presented as a typed calculus for mobile processes, the theory introduces a new notion of types in which interactions involving multiple peers are directly abstracted as a global scenario. Global types retain a friendly type syntax of binary session types while capturing complex causal chains of multiparty asynchronous interactions. A global type plays the role of a shared agreement among communication peers, and is used as a basis of efficient type checking through its projection onto individual peers. The fundamental properties of the session type discipline such as communication safety, progress and session fidelity are established for generaln-party asynchronous interactions.},

abstract = {We introduce the concept of unreliable failure detectors and study how they can be
used to solve Consensus in asynchronous systems with crash failures. We characterise
unreliable failure detectors in terms of two properties—completeness and accuracy.
We show that Consensus can be solved even with unreliable failure detectors that make
an infinite number of mistakes, and determine which ones can be used to solve Consensus
despite any  number of crashes, and which ones require a majority of correct processes.
We prove that Consensus and Atomic Broadcast are reducible to each other in asynchronous
systems with crash failures; thus, the above results also apply to Atomic Broadcast.
A companion paper shows that one of the failure detectors introduced here is the weakest
failure detector for solving Consensus [Chandra et al. 1992].},

consensus algorithm that tolerates non-Byzantine failures. General algorithms exist
that achieve these lower bounds in the normal case, when the response time of non-faulty
processes and the transmission delay of messages they send to one another are bounded.
Our theorems allow algorithms to do better in certain exceptional cases, and such
algorithms are presented. Two of these exceptional algorithms may be of practical
interest.},

This paper presents an assertion method, based on the $\pi$-calculus with full recursion, which generalises the notion of DbC to multiparty distributed interactions to enable effective specification and verification of distributed multiparty protocols. Centring on global assertions and their projections onto endpoint assertions, our method allows clear specifications for typed sessions, constraining the content of the exchanged messages, the choice of sub-conversations to follow, and invariants on recursions. The paper presents key theoretical foundations of this framework, including a sound and relatively complete compositional proof system for verifying processes against assertions.",

abstract = {We present the π-calculus, a calculus of communicating systems in which one can naturally express processes which have changing structure. Not only may the component agents of a system be arbitrarily linked, but a communication between neighbours may carry information which changes that linkage. The calculus is an extension of the process algebra CCS, following work by Engberg and Nielsen, who added mobility to CCS while preserving its algebraic properties. The π-calculus gains simplicity by removing all distinction between variables and constants; communication links are identified by names, and computation is represented purely as the communication of names across links. After an illustrated description of how the π-calculus generalises conventional process algebras in treating mobility, several examples exploiting mobility are given in some detail. The important examples are the encoding into the π-calculus of higher-order functions (the λ-calculus and combinatory algebra), the transmission of processes as values, and the representation of data structures as processes. The paper continues by presenting the algebraic theory of strong bisimilarity and strong equivalence, including a new notion of equivalence indexed by distinctions—i.e., assumptions of inequality among names. These theories are based upon a semantics in terms of a labeled transition system and a notion of strong bisimulation, both of which are expounded in detail in a companion paper. We also report briefly on work-in-progress based upon the corresponding notion of weak bisimulation, in which internal actions cannot be observed.}
