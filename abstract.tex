\chapter*{Abstract}
Achieving consensus among multiple, possibly faulty and unreliable processes is a fundamental problem in distributed computing.
In order to solve this consensus problem, consensus algorithms like Paxos must satisfy validity, agreement, and termination.
Proving these properties can be complicated.
Static analysis is preferable because model checking tools lead to big state-spaces.
Our aim in this work is to apply Fault-Tolerant Multiparty Session Types -- a fault-tolerant extension to Multiparty Session Types -- to statically analyze a consensus algorithm.
We construct a model of Paxos, including its fault-tolerant aspects.
Static analysis of that model helps us prove validity, agreement, and termination for it.
